## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Inria Lille - Nord Europe in [MODAL team](https://team.inria.fr/modal/) since January 2020. I work under the direction of [Christophe Biernacki](http://math.univ-lille1.fr/~biernack/) and [Hemant Tyagi](https://hemant-tyagi.github.io/) on inverse problems on graphs (mostly clustering and matching problems). I'm particulary interested in iterative methods including model-based approaches like EM algorithms and model-free approaches like generalized power methods. I'm also familiar with spectral methods, perturbation theory and concentration inequalities.
